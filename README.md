## Robot Trajectory Planning and PID Control System

Description:
This is a Github repository for a university project that focuses on developing a trajectory planning and PID control system for a robot to pick up several blocks. The project implements a global path-planner and a PID controller for accurate and efficient movement of the robot.

The main features of the project include:

* Image processing to obtain the top view of the robot and blocks it has to pick up, providing an accurate representation of the environment.
* Global path planning algorithm, which calculates the optimal path for the robot to reach its target location, considering obstacles in the environment.
* PID control system, which provides smooth and stable movement of the robot along the planned trajectory.
* Local trajectory adaptation, which enables the robot to adjust its trajectory based on the current position and target position.
The PID controller and local trajectory adaptation were performed by Sam Van Gysegem, a contributor to the project. The project also contains example applications showcasing the usage of the system, including block pick-and-place, and autonomous robot navigation.
